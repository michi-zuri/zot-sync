This is a Python package that can sync one or more Zotero libraries with a clone of the data in a PostgreSQL database. Currently only fetching is implemented. In the future it may be interesting to add features like pushing local edits, merging items, etc.

Currently only top-level items get fetched. Child items are ignored.
